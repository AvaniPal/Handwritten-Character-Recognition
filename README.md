# Handwritten-Character-Recognition

<B> Why Handwritten Character Recognition</B>

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognise the human
handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc.,
and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9).

Digit recognition has many applications like number plate recognition, postal mail
sorting, bank check processing, etc

In Handwritten digit recognition, we face many challenges because of different
styles of writing of different peoples as it is not an Optical character recognition.

<B>Problem Statement</B>

It is easy for the human to perform a task accurately
by practicing it repeatedly and memorising it for the
next time. Human brain can process and analyse
images easily. Also, recognise the different elements
present in the images.

The goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset
of tens of thousands of handwritten images and
experiment with different algorithms to learn
first-hand what works well and how techniques
compare.

<B>Dataset Decription</B>

we use the MNIST data
which is a large database of handwritten digits. The 'pixel
values' of each digit (image) comprise the features, and
the actual number
between 0-9 is the
label.

The data files train.csv and
test.csv contain gray-scale
images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine. The
training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first
column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user.
The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the
associated image.
